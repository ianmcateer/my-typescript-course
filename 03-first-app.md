# First app

our app will make a network request to fetch some JSON and print the result

we are going to accidently introduce one or two bugs and then we will see how ts shows us bugs whle we are writing code as opposed to when we execute our code

- take a look at the api we will use to fetch data 
- create a new directory
- crate a pachakge.json
- install axios
- write code

```
jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
```

scroll down to resources. we are going to fetch /todos

chrome extension to format data 

create new directory inside it run 

```
npm init -y
```

generate the file
then install axios
